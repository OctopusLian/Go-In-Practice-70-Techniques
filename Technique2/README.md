# Avoiding CLI boilerplate code  

## Problem  

```
Repeatedly, we find ourselves writing the same kinds of command-line programs. At
first, we think of them as disposable, but some of the tools we write end up growing far
beyond our initial expectations. Why keep writing the same boilerplate, only to be
faced later with refactoring the top level of the program? Are there tools that can pro-
vide a simple and repeatable pattern for rapidly building CLI programs?
